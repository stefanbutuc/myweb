                    Hi! I'm <strong>Butuc Stefan</strong>.
                </p>
<p>
  44 years ago I was born in a fairy tale country in the South-East of Europe. A country that gave the humanity famous persons like the first vampire in the world, Count Dracula, the first biologist who studied life in Antarctica, Emil Racovita, one of the most talented and promising musicians of the 20th century, George Enescu, or the pioneer of modernist sculpture, Constantin Brancusi. This is Romania, the country where Danube decided to flow into the Black Sea, after passing through or along 10 countries. 
</p>
<p>
  I am married and I am father for 6 boys - Stefan, 21, Alex, 20, Cezar, 16, George, 12, Spot and Bean, 6 years old - the last 2 are two rescued dogs, a 48 kilos American Staffy and a 5 kilos cross breed. 
</p>
<p>
  I like hiking in the mountains and swim in the sea ocean ... I love sun and rain, day and night ...
<p>
  Above all, I am a person who knows what he is, what he wants, what he can and who gets what he wants precisely because he wants what he can.
</p>
<p>
  I am a very motivated and ambitious person. I focus on purpose and touch it.
</p>
<p>
  I think I can bring a positive change in the lives of the others. 
</p>
<p>
  I am an analytical person with a very well-structured and mathematical mind. I have a very good capacity of learning quickly new sills, methods, processes, techniques, and languages. I have spontaneity in solving emerging problems. So it's normal to want to have a career in mathematics.
</p>
<p>
  IT is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future and (after Physics) is the second practical application of Mathematics. Any algorithm has more than just the logic: it has smell, taste, color, sound ... <strong>it has beauty!!!</strong> That's why I chose to work in IT and contribute to its development: because I have the necessary skills and because I like it.
</p>
<p>
  The importance of IT in human activities can no longer be denied. IT is involved everywhere. IT usually helps, and occasionally messes ... but without it we can not conceive the modern world. ‚Äú<a href=11.html>There is no life beyond IT!</a>‚Äù
</p>
<p>
  As I said, I know my qualities and weaknesses, so I chose to look for support in learning IT. There are so many, too many methods, systems and software, technologies, languages to learn them by myselves. So I chose to look for a guide, a tutor, a stalker. In order to be able to obtain a better guidance in this jungle, in this world wide web üåù, I started to look for the best to learn from them.  <a href=12.html>That is how I met CodeNation</a>!
