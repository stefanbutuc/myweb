          As a beginner in coding, my portfolio can not be too rich. Until now, I can only present the three digital projects I've been involved in:

    1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
  </p1>
  <p>                  
    Any coder-to-be should know and possess at least some elementary methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully (for a better illustration I chose to describe the accomplishment of my personal website). 
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to realize a successful IT project, you need a few specific skills and to know to use a few basic tools.
  </p>
  <p>                 
    <strong>Skills:</strong> You need to be creative, motivated, ambitious, but above all you have to be patient and open to learn and acquire new technologies. You need to be informed about the new trends and innovations. IT is a world where nobody is an expert and everybody needs to learn constantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tools:</strong> As long as you have these skills you can start applying the known IT tools in completing your digital projects. The shortest way is always the familiar way, but whenever time allows it, we must keep live the curiosity of finding and applying new solutions. Remember that you are in a growing field of activity. Do not stop yourself from learning.
  </p>

    1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
  </p1>
  <p>                  
    Any Digital Project can fail, and the dangers that can affect their good performance are many, but the biggest is the human factor: developer errors (especially those related to the poor reporting of the IT Development Strategy to the general Business Strategy)! 
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Dr. Dobbs</strong> did a survey on digital project execution a few years ago and found out that:
  <ul>             
    <li> Traditional projects: 47% are successful, 36% are challenged, and 17% are failures</p>
    <li> Ad-hoc projects: 49% are successful, 37% are challenged, and 14% are failures</li>
    <li> Agile projects: 60% are successful, 28% are challenged, and 12% are failures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <a href=http://blog.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process target=”_blank”>Mr. Jason Foster (BPM Delivery Director)</a> finds five major errors (which are related to a flawed Project Management): 
  </p>
  <em>
  <ol>
    <li> Misalignment with business processes (if the marketing overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail)
    <li> Lack of cross-functional expertise (every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes)
    <li> Limited digital strategy (focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals)
    <li> Fixed plans that don’t account for change (a digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment)
    <li> Overambition (the “done is better than perfect” mantra)</li>
  </ol>
  </em>

     1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact
                    digital projects?
  </p1>
  <p> 
      Before starting any digital project, it is a good idea to keep in mind <strong>the very strict legislation that constrains the IT field</strong> (<a href="5.html">here is a link to some useful information</a>)!

                window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};
                
                function scrollFunction() {
                  if (document.body.scrollTop > 20 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 20) {
                    document.getElementById("myBtn").style.display = "block";

                function topFunction() {
                  document.body.scrollTop = 0;
                  document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0;
