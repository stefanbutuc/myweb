                    Hi! I'm Butuc Stefan.

                    I am Romanian, born in Romania, 44 years ago ... married for the second time ... father of four boys ... owners of two dogs ... I like hiking in the mountains and swim in the sea ... I love sun and rain, day and night ...
                    
                    Above all, I am a person who knows what he is, what he wants, what he can and who gets what he wants precisely because he wants what he can.
                    
                    I am a very motivated and ambitious person. I focus on purpose and touch it.
                    
                    I think I can bring a change in the lives of others and what they are doing. 
                    
                    I am an analytical person with a very well-structured, mathematical mind. I have a very good capacity of learning quickly new approaches, methods, processes , techniques, languages. I have spontaneity in solving emerging problems. So it's normal to want to have a career in mathematics.
                    
                    IT is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future and (after Physics) is the second practical application of Mathematics. Any algorithm has more than just the logic: it has smell, taste, color, sound ... it has beauty!!! That's why I chose to work in IT and contribute to its development: because I have the necessary skills and because I like it.
                    
                    The importance of IT in human activities can no longer be denied. IT is involved everywhere. IT usually helps, and occasionally messes ... but without it we can not conceive the modern world. ‚Äú<a href=‚Äù11.html‚Äù>There is no life beyond IT!</a>‚Äù
                    
                    As I said, I know my qualities and weaknesses so I chose to look for support in learning IT. There are so many, to many methods, systems and software, technologies, languages to learn them by myselves. So I chose to look for a guide, a tutor, a stalker. In order to be able to orientate in this jungle, in this world wide web üåù, I started to look for the best for learning from them.  <a href=‚Äù12.html‚Äù>That is how I met CodeNation</a>!
