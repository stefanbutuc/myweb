<h2> “My Website”</h2>
<p1> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.
	</p1>
	<p>
(<em>How do I plan it? <a href="https://trello.com/b/7u0AfIYg" target=”_blank”>Here is a link to my trello board</a></em>) 
</p>
<p>
First of all, for more accuracy of my Project Management I have googled for the stages in execution of a website. 
</p>
<p>

I finally decided about this stages for my project: 
</p>
<p>

<em>Step 1. <strong>My own Kanban</strong> </em>
	<br>1. To decide and record on Trello how I break down my project in activities  
</p><p>
<br><em>Step 2. <strong>Gathering Information</strong>:</em> 
<br>2. Purpose, 
<br>3. Main Goals, and 
<br>4. Target Audience
	<br>5. Create a budget (my resource is the time so “establishes a time limit for the achievement”)  
	<br>6. Choose the proper IT tools. 
	<br>7.  Create my own logo and collecting the pictures.
</p>
<p>
<br><em>Step 3. <strong>Effective execution of the website</strong> </em>
<br>8. Create a Content Strategy.
<br>9. Planning Sitemap.
<br>10. Create the Content. 
<br>11. Wireframe Creation. 
<br>12. Design: Page Layouts, Review, and Approval Cycle. 
<br>13. HTML editing. 
<br>14. Test offline (riview if necessary). 
<br>15. Styling with CSS & JavaScript (if needed).
<br>16. Test offline (riview if necessary).
</p>
<p>
<br><em>Step 4. <strong>Publishing</strong> </em>
<br>17. Find and choose a Hosting Solution.
<br>18. Publishing my site. 
<br>19. Test online (by myself and by other).
</p><p>
<br><em>Step 5. <strong>Maintenance & Advertising</strong> </em>
<br>22. Advertising. 
<br>21. Maintenance.    
</p>
<p>

I set up all this steps in my own Trello.  
</p>
<p1>
1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
</p1>
<p>
To accomplish my project, I have chosen the following tools (I chose the best-known and comfortable ones, but being prepared at any time to learn new ones - respecting any set deadline): 
<ul>
<li> Visual Studio Code (for writing  and debugging all my codes - html, css, javascript); </li> 
<li> Browser: Google Chrome (main - for develop ); Microsoft Internet Explorer,Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari (only for tests);</li>
<li> Editor: Visual Studio Media;</li>
<li> Kanban: Trello platform (for a good project management);</li>
<li> FTProtocol: Total Commander;</li>
<li> Hosting and Test: Codepen;</li>
<li> to communicate with colleagues and to distribute my website (to get feedback for the latest review): Slack;  </li>
<li> Graphic design: Microsoft Paint & Paint3D and</li>
<li> first of all Google search engine.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
When I start my project I decided to learn (at least) about <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Codepen</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
I have decided on the following deadlines: 
<ul>
<li> Monday 13 May (12:30) - 14th Activity to be completed!!!!</li>
<li> The 19th Activities must be completed till Tuesday 14 May;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately some personal issues have occurred and I had been forced to change the deadlines as follows:
<ul>
<li> Tuesday 14 May (12:30): to be ready Activity 10 (content / text);</li>
<li> Tuesday 14 May (17:30): to perform the Activity 14 (HTML Test);</li>
<li> Wednesday 15 May (13:30): the website is published and presented to colleagues;</li>
<li> Wednesday 15 May (17:00): feedback and a last review if necessary;</li>
<li> Thursday 16 May (17:00): final assessment submit;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p1>

1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
</p1>
<p1>

2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
</p1>
<p>
<strong>Trello</strong> has proved very useful in setting up the activities, the stages that I have to go through in order to complete the project. Without it, I would have been struggling to deal with the delays caused by the personal problems that occurred on Monday.
</p>
<p>

Unfortunately, the greatly shortening of the project's time did not allow me to learn new techniques and to use new development platforms. So Visual Studio Code has proven to be very useful for writing HTML, CSS and JS codes. He allowed me to debug them and visualize them in action.
</p>
<p>

The <strong>Google Drive</strong> platform has also proved very useful, allowing me to work on the content of the site, both at school and at home.
</p>
<p>

In order to make the logo and presentation graphics I used <a href="https://www.freelogodesign.org/" target="_blank">editor.freelogodesign.org/</a>. This site helped me to get rid of the copyright law.
</p>
<p>

I decided to use photos from my personal archive (from the same legal reason) and adjusted them using the old and classic <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> (which though working very roughly proved satisfactory).
</p>
<p1>

2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
</p1>
<p1>
2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
</p1>
<p1>
2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
</p1>
<p>

I am determined to keep the current website structure, but I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the graphic elements involved, the quality of the content (which often does not help to achieve the objectives - is not comprehensive and coherent enough). I am also unhappy about how I stylized the page design. The fault is that I did not have enough time to study CSS and find and apply the effects that I wanted.
</p>
<p>

The fact is that this document can not be made public in this form. You need to work on content and aesthetics.
</p>
<p1>

(RED!!!)3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
</p1>
<p>

The time to achieve this project is proved to be too short for my level of coding knowledges. The product obtained can only have an experimental character. Teamwork (by simply distributing tasks to colleagues) could have greatly shortened the production time and probably increased the quality of the final product. But its character, its Purpose and Goals (to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities) would not recommend a teamwork.
</p>
<p1>

3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</p1>
<p1>
3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</p1>
<p> 
I could have been more productive if I had not focused on content at the expense of design and “form”. I would have gained much more time if I had prepared first the “form” to put the text further.
</p>
<p1>
 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</p1>
<p>
The functionality of the website has been verified in three steps:
<ul>
<li> Offline after HTML editing and post-CSS styles;</li>
<li> online (after posting on the server).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Design and content were then presented to colleagues and teachers to get feedback, which led to a review.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this task is upcoming (but priority for me). Following the date of submission of the assessment.
