                    </p1>
                    <p1>The brief

                    </p1>
                    <p1><strong>Scenario</strong></p1> 
                    <p1>You are wanting to set up as a consultant. To prove your knowledge you want to start by creating a blog talking about yourself, why you are interested in technology and demonstrate how much you know. For each of the sections below asking you to describe, include around a paragraph of information about the topic. 
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    The modern world can not be conceived without IT. Computer technologies are applicable in all areas and human activities. I talked about this topic on the “<a href="11.html" target="_blank">There is no life beyond IT</a>” page (link from the "Testimony" page). 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    
                    I've covered the topic in the “<a href="2.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>" page. Creativity is an important quality of a good coder, but his first two main qualities must be <strong>determination</strong> and <strong>curiosity</strong>. The domain of IT technologies and methods is a very rich and complex one, so no one can hope to know and master it altogether. You need to be prepared to learn new approaches all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Google (and any other search engine) must be the best friend of a coder. Opportunities are immense. All you need for a web page is a browser, a code editor and some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. And a lot of <strong>patience</strong> and <strong>determination</strong>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board. 
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    First of all, I've been looking for tips on the steps you need to take to build a digital project. Later I decided on my own Kanban (<a href="http://trello.com/b/7u0AfIYg" target="_blank">here you have a link to my Trello</a>).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    The topic was treated on the "<a href="2.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>" page. I agree with the sources cited there, that the greatest danger to a digital project is that it does not correspond to the company's overall strategy. Other elements of risk for a project are related to the qualities and knowledge of the code editor.You do not have to overestimate your strength because you risk losing it.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
                    </p1>
                    <p style="color:orange">
                    The steps I followed in making this site should have been described on the "<a href="23.html" target="_blank">My Website</a>" page (link from the "Portfolio" page). Because I do not think that the page is well structured (it is not a “solid” one - I must review it), I will resume here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I also mentioned in Trello that I chose to use the tools known to the course (according to the mantra "the shortest way, is the way known"), but decided that to the extent that time will allow me to learn new elements as well.
                    <br>
                    Software and Tools:
                    <ul>
                    <li> <em>Browser</em>: Google Chrome (main - for develop); Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari (only for tests); 
                    </li>
                    <li> <em>Editor</em>: Visual Studio Media;
                    </li>
                    <li> <em> Kanban</em>: Trello platform;
                    </li>
                    <li> <em>Search Engine</em>: www.Google.com
                    </li>
                    <li> <em>FTProtocol</em>: Total Commander or those placed at the platform where I will host my website;
                    </li>
                    <li> <em>Hosting and Test</em>: Github or Codepen;
                    </li>
                    <li> <em>Graphic design</em>: Microsoft Paint & Paint3D;
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    Trello helped me monitor the deadlines at every stage. It is a very good way to count time and other resources or activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> is a great editor for a beginner because it allows writing in many programming languages. The only weak point is that it only works on a terminal, it saves the document only in a PC. I have encountered difficulties in transferring my documents from one computer to another (only in the last days of the course I learned how to work with <strong>Github</strong>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The <strong>Google Drive</strong> platform has also been very useful, allowing me to work on the content of the site, both at school and at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The graphic elements involved were (and will be - during the Maintenance stage) photographs from the personal archive or personal creations (to avoid copyright infringement). For example, to make the logo I used the website <a href="http://www.freelogodesign.org" target="_blank">www.freelogodesign.org</a>.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    There is legislation specific to each field of activity where IT is involved, but two major topics are general: <strong>Copyright</strong> and <strong>GDPR</strong>. I have treated them in the "<a href="5.html" target="_blank">Legal Constraint</a>" page. In principle, <a href="51.html" target="_blank">GDPR</a> sets out how companies should manipulate the personal information of EU citizens, and <a href="52.html" target="_blank">copyright</a> sets the limits on whether or not we can use the intellectual creation of another person.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1><strong>Outcome 2</strong>: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are Successful
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1><strong>Scenario</strong></p1>
                    <p1>Now you have setup your blog, it’s time to get into the detail. You now need to critically review your website. To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information.
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello
                    </p1>
                    <p1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    As I have already said, Visual Studio Code is a very useful code-editing platform that perfectly satisfies the needs of a beginner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Trello</strong> is very useful for team communication, but the specificity of this project is supposed to prove the OWN LEVEL of knowledge, so it must be the result of INDIVIDUAL WORK. So I did not use it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Codepen was unnecessary because all the tests we performed off-line using the Google Chrome browser and the editing was done with VSC. GitHub is much more useful, but I'll find it much later.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
                    </p1>
                    <p1>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    My website is still poor. As a beginner, I can not build a rich portfolio.
                    <br>There are many improvements that can be made:
                    <ul>
                    <li> first of all, the quality of the text / content must be improved;
                    </li>
                    <li> more graphic elements need to be added, and they must have a more attractive design;
                    </li>
                    <li> the colors should be brighter (I used too much gray but the desire to suggest professionalism, but too much).
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    My overall view is that the structure and wireframes are good, only design and content are weak.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p1>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    The results are satisfactory. The elements mentioned in the previous paragraph still need to be worked out. But the project goes hand in hand with the main purpose set when I started the project.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p1><strong>Outcome 3</strong>: Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems

                    </div>
                    <p1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? 
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                        I used the “<strong>www.freelogodesign.org</strong>” website to make the logo, and for manipulating photos or other graphics I chose to use <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> (old, unreliable, but for superficial changes it still does its job ).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> is so far (but I'm just the debutant in the field) the best code editing tool. It covers a very wide range of programming languages. Allows "debug" (unfortunately very necessary for me). Unfortunately, it does not allow team work or different terminals. Documents worked by different individuals or from different locations need to be transported and associated through other programs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        VSC has an advantage: it can be associated with <strong>Github</strong>. And so (together) they become an essential tool for code writing. Here I used the Github for the first time. Allows free site publishing and content storage. A weak point of GitHub is that it does not allow VSC work directly on the server. Any change made involves uploading and / or offline testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About IT tools and systems used so far, I spoke at the previous points. I have already said that this project can be done in the team (by distributing each of the activities from Kanban) but t<strong>hat it is not ethical</strong> (the main purpose of the project is to demonstrate personal qualities).
                    </p>
                        
                    
                    <p1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    Productivity and efficiency can be enhanced by better knowledge of tools, languages, and IT programs in use. Gaining experience leads to shorter production times and superior product quality.

                    The next project will go much better and faster. My main mistake was to give priority to content, to the detriment of form and appearance.

                    </p1>
                    <p>
                    For this project we had three testing stages. Each of them assumed a “Test - Problem -  Solving - Test” cycle until the time I was relatively satisfied with my solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The first two tests were performed offline to verify the HTML, CSS, and Javascript scripts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The last test was made after publishing the website and was made using several browsers and several types of devices (static and mobile).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Follows the continuous cycle “Test - Problem - Solution" (specific to the maintenance process, which involves continuous reporting to feedback).

                      For someone who has a visual impairment is recommended the  uses of screen reader (software program that reads text on a website out loud) and “alt tag” function.
